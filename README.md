## diffusion-relaxation MRI data from biomimetic phantoms
We provide diffusion-relaxation MRI data and methods for estimating the inner fibre radius of biomimetic phantoms 🎁.

Scanning Electron Micrographs depicting the microscopic morphology of the biomimetic phantoms. All phantom samples are shown using the same length scale. Phantom1 and Phantom2 are displayed together as both were built using similar distributions of inner fibre radii.
